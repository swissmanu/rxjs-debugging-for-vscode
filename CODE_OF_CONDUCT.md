# Code of Conduct

## Rules

To keep it simple, we only have three basic rules:

1. Don't panic
2. Don't be evil
3. Don't feed the trolls

## Examples

The following non-exhaustive list provides specific guidelines and examples:

- Be respectful, be responsible, be kind
- Avoid asking for deadlines
- Don't feel entitled to free support, advice, or features if you are not a [contributor](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- If you have a [general question](https://github.com/swissmanu/rxjs-debugging-for-vscode/discussions), don't use GitHub Issues
- If you are having a bad day and want to offend someone, please go somewhere else

## Reporting

We encourage all community members to resolve problems on their own whenever possible. Instances of abusive,
harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be [reported](mailto:rxjsdebugging@alabor.me) to us.

## Enforcement

Any violation may be punished with a snarky comment and finally a "plonk", which means that we ignore you according to rule #3.
